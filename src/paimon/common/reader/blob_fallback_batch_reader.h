/// Merges the blob files of one data-evolution blob bunch that span multiple max sequence
/// number layers, resolving placeholder entries row by row. Aligned with Java's
/// BlobFallbackRecordReader / AllPlaceholdersRecordReader.
///
/// A data-evolution partial update rewrites only the touched rows of a blob column; the new blob
/// file records every untouched row as a placeholder entry. Reading therefore needs, per row, the
/// value from the newest layer that holds a real (non-placeholder) entry:
///
/// 1. The caller groups the blob files by max sequence number (one group per layer, newest
///    first) and, inside each group, orders them by first row id. Row id ranges the group's
///    files do not cover are represented by gap segments, which stand for all-placeholder rows.
/// 2. All groups span the same overall row id range, so with the same row-ranges selection
///    applied they yield the same number of rows and can be stepped in lockstep. A deletion
///    vector has to reach every group the same way, through the file segments' readers and
///    through the row ids the caller leaves in a gap segment's `gap_selected_ranges`.
/// 3. Each output row takes the first group, in max-sequence order, whose row is not a
///    placeholder. Placeholder rows are identified by exact equality with the
///    BlobDefs::kPlaceholderSentinel bytes, emitted by the blob format reader when
///    BlobDefs::kEmitPlaceholderSentinelKey is set.
/// 4. A row that is a placeholder in every group degrades to a null blob: it keeps its
///    _ROW_ID, reports -1 as its _SEQUENCE_NUMBER, and returns null for every other field.
